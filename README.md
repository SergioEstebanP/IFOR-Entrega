### Objectives
---
The main goal of this repository is to bring some software build from scratch to the forensics field into the software development. The software shown in this repository is extremly simple but could be a proof of concept or a seed to make bigger projects if the community wants to. 

### Tools used in the project
---

Main tools used are:

- **Visual Studio Code**: main IDE to develop the software. Very usefull due to the integration with SCV tools as git and all the usefull plugins. You can obtain more information here [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Gradle**: for build the project and make all the folders and settings to the project. Combined with intellij for download dependencies, it is so powerful. You can get more information at [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- **Github**: to have a control version and share knowledge with rest of the world. You can find more software projects in my Github account. 
- **JavaFX**: the future of graphics in Java, it combine the power of CSS and the simplicity of awt to make bright and colourful gui's. See [JavaFX documentation](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/documentation/index.html) to get more information.
